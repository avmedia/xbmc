This directory contains XBMC custom patches that are refactored to fit the FFmpeg
n1.2 rev e820e3a distribution. 

All patches in the patches folder are already applied to the ffmpeg code base and
are only kept here for tracking history. Some of patches are ours and some are
backports from ffmpegs upstream. Patches that have become obsolete since ffmpeg
n0.10.2 are moved to the directory obsolete-patches, also for tracking reasons.

Normally you can have a look into that patchfile itself to see if its a backport
or not (we normally leave the original commit message and the committer in there).
You can also use "git log lib/ffmpeg/patches" to show the history where the patch
file came from.

Whenever you need to patch a new ffmpeg versions you apply the patch and then add
the git diff to the patches folder in the next commit. If its a backport - adapt
the patch so that it clearly states that it is a change from upstream and which
commit in ffmpeg repo it is. Please pick an uniq patch number that doesn't
conflict with others in both the directories /patches and /patches/obsolete-patches
